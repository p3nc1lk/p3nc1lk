## Background 🛸
- I'm an accounting student @ Ball State 🐦
- No real projects because I'm not a CS major
- I don't know what I'm doing but stuff tends to work out

## Projects (if you can call them that)
* [Christmas Tree](https://github.com/p3nc1lk/Christmas-Tree): Custom Christmas Tree lights inspired by Matt Parker
* JonF bot: lost on a thumbdrive somewhere
